# List of Changes performed


# File changes:
    * |-DATA 
      |  |-CHEMICAL - Contains downloaded MUTAG and PROTEINS, also the rewired data (eg:<dataset-name>_rewired&original_preprocessed.pt)
      |- PROTEIN.pt, MUTAG.pt - Are the same files as <dataset-name>_rewired&original_preprocessed.pt, moved the files for ease of access  

    * results_PROTEINS contains the results, logs, and the best config

# graph.py:
    one function altered.
    one function added- rewire function

    FINAL CHANGES:
    DISREGARD THIS FILE: NOT useful, as the rewire fxn is move to rewire.py and PrepareDatasets.py

# GraphSAGE.py:
    Accomodated changes pertaining to rewire, i.e all layers rewire/ final layer rewire

    Final changes:
    1st let's try the model with only final layer rewired
    Hard coded the boolean.

# config_GraphSAGE.yml
    Added the 'use_rewired_for_all_layers' config parameter

    Final/Recent Change:
    * Removed the config parameter

# PrepareDatasets.py:
    * Wrote a new function for preprocessing that will perform rewiring for all datasets.
    * retains the og edge_index also
    - What is the use of "--outer-k" and "inner_k" inside PrepareDatasets.py


    Final changes: 
    * just pasted the rewire_graph fxn, was unable to import it from rewire.py
    * Disregarded a little bit of original code, and used TUDataset installation step a mandatory part.
    

# Netwrapper.py:
    * Accomodated rewired_edge_index in train and classify_graph functions.




# config_BaselineChemical.yml
    NOTE: this file apparently overrides the model config.
    * changed model in config_BaselineChemical.yml to GraphSAGE from molecularfingreprint

    Recent change:
    *  Multi------> Binary loss

Sun April 27th:
Removing the boolean flag for rewired_all_layers


# Ran Experiments:
    # PROTEIN run:
        Preproc script:  python PrepareDatasets.py DATA/CHEMICAL --dataset-name PROTEINS --outer-k 10 --use-rewired -
        Launch exp script: python Launch_Experiments.py --config-file config_BaselineChemical.yml --dataset-name PROTEINS --result-folder results_PROTEINS --debug
        unfortunately ran the experiment with multiclass classification, but still the model ran for 5000 epochs and started the k = 2 CV, so it is working.

# Made changes to make use of rewire_for_all_layers flag
